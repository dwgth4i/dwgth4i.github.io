I'm into stuff related to Offensive Security a lot, and my blog is mostly Vietnamese which is my first language. The majority of my self-studying process is for doing AD labs/boxes on HackThebox, and Vulnlab (GOAT). Besides, I like Japanese culture and currently try to learn some binary exploitation and Windows internals.
