Hey, I'm dwgth4i, I enjoy playing CTF on HackTheBox and VulnLab and in the free time, I study all the side about Red Teaming and Windows.

Formerly I do a lot of Web, but now I'm mostly learning/focusing on:

- Kernel Exploitation
- Windows IPC
- Active Directory
- Malware Development

You can find me on Discord as **dwgth4i** :)
