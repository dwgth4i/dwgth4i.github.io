I'm a dude with a deep passion for offensive security, particularly Windows internals and Active Directory. My journey into cybersecurity began in mid-2023, and since then, I've been continuously learning and exploring the intricacies of how systems work—and how they can be secured (or compromised), when I'm not diving into security research or setting up lab environments, you can find me on a random football field or some ranked fighting game.
